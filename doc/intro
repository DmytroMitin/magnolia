__Magnolia__ is a generic macro for automatic materialization of typeclasses for
datatypes composed from *case classes* (products) and *sealed traits*
(coproducts). It supports recursively-defined datatypes out-of-the-box, and
incurs no significant time-penalty during compilation. If derivation fails,
error messages are detailed and informative.
